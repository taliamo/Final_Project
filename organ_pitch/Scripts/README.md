# Scripts information
# All script files for the organ pitch project are stored 
#in this "Scripts" repository.

Scripts contain code for:
Uploading data;

Sorting and rearranging data ("upload_pitch_data" and "upload_env_data");

Finding mean values for musical note frequency and CO2 concentration (same as above);

Visualizing data ( );

Running statistical tests on data ("stats_compare");

There is a Makefile while acts as a driver script to run the other scripts. It includes a "make clean" command, which can reset the directories for the scripts to be re-run.
