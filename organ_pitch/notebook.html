Chronology of commands for Directory_Creator_Day1.
I first made a root director, 
then created notebook, README, and LICENSE files in it. 
I then put in text into the notebook and README files. 
Then I created Data, Results, and Doc directories. 
Each contain a README.md file. Each README.md file has info about what type of information is contained in each.

Option 1 for this project: compare environmental data from the one sensor that is attached to the CO2 sensor. THis will give me one set of temp, RH, and CO2 measurements per time sample.

Option 2: I compare that sensor with others in different locations to compare how Temp and RH are different in location, and make mathematical relationships between CO2 in other places based on the math. relationship between temp and RH in different locations. To do this, I would use RegEx's to match sampling times and compare datasets between sample locations (by merging data by appending columns beside one another...ex: Temp_choir_div and Temp_great_swell).


2015-11-10: having problems with data formatting between .hobo and .csv (opened in Excel) and reading into Python. Maybe it's an issue with Excel. I have solved the issue for now.

2015-11-11: I'm going to make one main script with a chronology of operations

2015-11-12: New game plan: make separate scripts, because I discovered there need to be separate upload/munging scripts for the RH, temp, and CO2 data files versus the pitch files. 

So, script types:
1) upload_env --uploads, munges, makes outputs that can interact with pitch data
2) upload_pitch --uploads, munges, makes outputs that can interact with env. data
3) 
4)
